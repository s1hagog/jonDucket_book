    <h2>THe Composition of Seawater</h2>
    <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissloved materials from Earth's crust
        as well as materials released from organisms. The most important components of seawater that
        influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxegyn and carbon dioxide), nutrients
        and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.
